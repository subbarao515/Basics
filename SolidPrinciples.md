# SOLID stands for 

1.**S** - Single-responsiblity Principle(SRP)

    A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job
   
2.**O** - Open-closed Principle(OCP)
 
    A software module/class is open for extension and closed for modification

3.**L** - Liskov Substitution Principle(LSP)

    You should be able to use any derived class instead of a parent class and have it behave in the same manner without modification

4.**I** - Interface Segregation Principle(ISP)

    clients should not be forced to implement interfaces they don't use

5.**D** - Dependency Inversion Principle(DIP)
  
    High level modules should not depend on low level modules
