## Design Patterns
Design Patterns is a reusable solution to common software design problems

Design Pattern provides low-level solutions related to the implementation, of commonly occurring object-oriented problems. In other words, the design pattern suggests a specific implementation for the specific object-oriented programming problem

1.Creational Patterns

  Creational design pattern gives the programmer more flexibility in deciding object creation and initialization
   
    [1.Singleton](https://csharp-video-tutorials.blogspot.com/2017/05/singleton-design-pattern.html)
      Concurrent access to the resource is well managed by singleton design pattern.
    2.Builder
      Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation
    3.Prototype
    4.Abstract Factory
      The Abstract Factory Design Pattern provides a way to encapsulate a group of individual factories that have a common theme without specifying their concrete classes
      Abstract Factory is a super factory that creates other factories
    5.Factory Method
    
2.Structural Patterns

3.Behavioral Patterns
